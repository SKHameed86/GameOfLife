The code doesn't work - I was unable to debug the code, as the recommended debugger failed to install to the directory.

With regards to the exercise, it was assumed that I had to add to and complete the code that was provided in the golSpec and gol files.

This was attempted; the Rules were straighforward enough, as was setting up the grids for the Game.

However, the goal of my code was to copy the initialState array to an intermediary (mirrorState), where the rules could be applied by determining how many neighbours the living cells had.

With the rules successfully applied, the new state of the cells would be passed to the newState array, and there would be a counter to track how many iterations there had been.
